# test 2

I'm a progammer. I've always wanted to have a personal website to showcase my projects and share my thoughts. I've looked into various blogging platforms like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Substack](https://substack.com), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). But, I chose Github Pages with Jekyll because I wanted to have:
1. Full control over my blog and I wanted to customize it to my taste. 
2. A blog that is free and doesn't require me to pay for hosting. 
3. A blog that is simple, fast and easy to maintain doesn't require me to spend hours to configure it.
